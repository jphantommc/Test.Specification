// a fuction called "Multiplication" should multiply two integers and return the product of the two intergers
// expect Multiplication(10, 10) should give you a number
// expect Multiplication (10, 10) should equal too 100
// expect Multiplication ('x', 10) should give you an error since 'x' is not an integer
// expect Multiplication should multiply with eachother regardless of the integers that were inserted or the order the were inserted
// when the user inserts a 1 to be multiplied the result should be the number that is multipled by 1
// when a user interts a 0 when multipled the result should be 0

// a function called "concarOdds" should give you the results of all odd numbers with the numbers the user inputs
// expect concatOdd (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) should return o d numbers
// expect concatOdd (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) result should be (1,3,5,7)
// the numbers inserted should show from least to greatest order
// if (7,9,5,4,7,2,8,3,5) the result should display (3,5,7,9)
// when a number shows multiple times it should only show once
// if (1,1,1,2,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7) the result should be (1,3,5,7)
// all odd numbers including negative numbers should still show (-1,1,2,3,4,)
// the result should display (-1,1,3) since even if its negative it is still an odd number
// an error should display if the inputs show (2,4,6,8) since there is no odd numbers 
// same error should display if no numbers were inputted (a,b,c,d,e)

// a feature that allows customers to checkout as guest
// this feature should ask the user if they would like to sign up to become a member
// When the customer sign in to their account the system should pull their information to sign in 
// if the user wants to create an account they would have to insert an email and password

// if the customer already has an account but inserts a wrong email or password an error should appear
// once the user has signed on or proceeded as a guest they should get taken to the checkout page 
// if the shopping cart is empty, a "Cart is empty" message should appear 
// if user does not have an email they can proceed as a guest
// in checkout page Biling information, shipping information, card information appear after either proceeding as a guest or signing into the account
// if there is an error with the card information, a error message should appear
